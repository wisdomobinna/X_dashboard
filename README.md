# Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive KPI (Key Performance Indicator) dashboard for a company, created using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes crucial business metrics derived from the company's sales data, aiding in strategic decision-making and performance evaluation.

## Data Source
The dashboard utilizes data from `sheet1`, which is a dataset detailing various aspects of company sales. This data can be found in two forms:

- **CSV File**: Located in the `csv` folder, this file contains a structured dataset ready for analysis.
- **Superstore Sales Data Table**: A more extensive dataset providing a broader scope of sales data. This larger dataset offers a more in-depth analysis for comprehensive insights.

## Features of the Dashboard
The KPI dashboard developed in Power BI includes features such as:

- **Sales Performance Tracking**: Visualize sales trends over time, compare yearly or monthly performances, and monitor sales growth.
- **Customer Insights**: Understand customer behavior, segment performance, and identify key customer groups.
- **Product Analysis**: Analyze product performance, category-wise sales, and identify top-performing and underperforming products.
- **Financial Metrics**: Keep track of revenue, profits, and other financial KPIs critical for the business.
- **Interactive Filters**: Use interactive filters to drill down into specific time periods, regions, categories, or other relevant dimensions.

## Installation and Setup
To use the dashboard:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wisdomobinna/X_dashboard.git
